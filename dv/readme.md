# RISC-V design verification and compliance

## Simple testbenches
Prerequisites:

- RISC-V GNU toolchain (assumes rv32i)
- cocotb >= 2.0
- iverilog
- verilator
- yosys
- zachjs/sv2v

### Cocotb tests
The directory `tb/cocotb_asm` contains a cocotb testbench with several tests
that check if a set of instructions will execute and produce the expected
results on the core.
Each assembly file in `asm` will be compiled and loaded into the memory model.
At the end of each test, the testbench will check the register and data memory
values against the expected values.

### Block level SystemVerilog tests
The directories  `tb/sv_*` contains testbenches for block-level tests.
These are sanity check tests so that each module functions as expected.
Each test will run both icarus and verilator simulators, and will run on pre-
and post-sytthesis top modules.
Synthesis is done with `yosys` and `sv2v`.

You can choose which tests to run with:
```
make iverilog.vcd
make iverilog_gls.vcd
make verilator.vcd
make verilator_gls.vcd
```

## uvm testbench
The directory `tb/uvm` contains the uvm testbench structure.
It runs compiled files similar to cocotb, but allows for loading different data
for the instruction and data memory.
It's main usage for now is for [riscof](#riscv-arch-test).
For usage refer to the uvm directory [readme](../tb/uvm/readme.md)

## riscv-arch-test
Prerequisites:

- riscof
- riscv-arch-test
- sail-riscv
- RISC-V GNU toolchain (assumes rv32i)
- The [uvm testbench](#uvm-testbench)

The test already assumes riscof and sail-riscv is installed and in the `PATH`,
and that the environment variable `ARCH_TEST_DIR` points to the cloned
riscv-arch-test repository.

To install riscof to run without any additonal config:
```
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
git clone https://github.com/riscv-non-isa/riscv-arch-test
pip3 install --editable riscv-arch-test/riscv-ctg
pip3 install --editable riscv-arch-test/riscv-isac
pip3 install git+https://github.com/riscv/riscof.git
```

Run the tests with
```
make run-riscof
```
