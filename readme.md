# risc v core
A cpu core that implements the RV32I instruction set.

## Verification
Testbenches are placed in the `tb/` directory.
Design verification tools are placed in the `dv/` directory.

To run basic tests, you can choose to run either a basic SystemVerilog testbench, Cocotb tests, or a uvm test.

To run the RISC-V architectural tests, go to the `dv/riscof` dir and run `make run-riscof`.
See the expectations in the readme file in `dv/`.
